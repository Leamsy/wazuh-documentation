Using the RESTful API
=====================

As with the command line, certain tasks can be performed via the RESTful API.
Using simple commands as ``GET`` and ``POST`` users can register, list and remove agents and all their different variants:

.. topic:: Contents

    .. toctree::
        :maxdepth: 2

        register
        listing
        remove
